#### Problem

:::note

#### Solution

Here's a quick fix to help you install `mysqlclient` successfully:
**1. Install MySQL Client**: First, let's install an older version of MySQL client that's known to work well:

```shell
// highlight-start
brew install mysql-client@5.7
// highlight-end

# If you need to have mysql-client@5.7 first in your PATH, run:
#   echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client@5.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc#

# For compilers to find mysql-client@5.7 you may need to set:
#   export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client@5.7/lib"
#   export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client@5.7/include"#

# For pkg-config to find mysql-client@5.7 you may need to set:
#   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client@5.7/lib/pkgconfig"

// highlight-start
pip3 install mysqlclient==2.2.4
// highlight-end
```

**2. Update Your PATH:**

To make sure your system recognizes the newly installed MySQL client first, update your PATH by adding the following line to your ~/.zshrc file:

```shell
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client@5.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**3. Set Compiler Flags:**

Help your compilers find the MySQL client:

```shell
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client@5.7/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client@5.7/include"
```

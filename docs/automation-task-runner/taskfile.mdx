# Taskfile

## What is a Taskfile?

:::note
[Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev)  is a task runner and build tool designed to be simpler and easier to use than traditional tools like GNU Make. It operates with a single binary called task and requires no additional dependencies. Taskfile allows you to define tasks using a simple YAML schema in a Taskfile.yml file.
:::

### 1. Why need a Taskfile?

Taskfile offers several advantages over traditional build tools:

* Simplicity: Taskfile simplifies task automation with a straightforward YAML syntax.
* Portability: Taskfile is a single binary that works across different platforms without additional dependencies.
* Flexibility: Taskfile supports advanced features like task dependencies, variables, and error handling.
* CLI Integration: Taskfile tasks can be executed directly from the command line, making it easy to integrate with other tools and scripts.

### 2. Features of Taskfile

`Taskfile` provides a range of features to streamline your development workflow:

* Task Definitions: Define tasks in a `Taskfile.yml` using a simple YAML schema.
* Task Dependencies: Specify task dependencies to ensure tasks run in the correct order.
* Variables: Use variables within tasks to store and reuse values.
* Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully by ignoring or failing tasks based on conditions.
* OS based tasks: Run tasks based on the operating system
* Concurrent Tasks: Run tasks concurrently to improve performance.
* Conditional Logic: Implement if-else conditions to control task execution.
* Loops: Use loops to iterate over tasks and execute them multiple times.
* Template Tasks: Create task templates for reuse across multiple tasks.
* Import remote tasks: Import tasks from remote repositories or URLs.

## Getting Started

### 1 Install and Define OS-Specific Tasks

Before starting with Taskfile, you need to install Task on your system. Task is a powerful task runner that makes automation in your projects easy and efficient.

* Remove any existing Task installation (if applicable):
```bash
rm -rf $(which task)
```

* Install Task using the following command:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b /usr/local/bin
```

* Verify the installation:
  * After installation, check if Task is installed by running:
```bash
# The output should include the version of Task installed.
task --version
```

### 2 First Taskfile

Test with first Taskfile.

* Create a new directory named `~/test_taskfile`:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/test_taskfile
```

* Create a new file named `Taskfile.yml` inside the `~/test_taskfile` directory:
```bash
touch ~/test_taskfile/Taskfile.yml
```

* Adding a task to Taskfile
```bash
version: '3'

tasks:
  hello:
    cmds:
      - echo "Hello World" > ~/test_taskfile/output.txt
```

* Run the hello task:
```bash
cd ~/test_taskfile
task hello
```

## Environment Variables and Advanced Usage

### 1. Environment Variables

Explore how to use environment variables, task variables, and dynamic variables within Taskfile.
How to set, override, and utilize these variables effectively in Taskfile.

Taskfile supports the use of environment variables, similar to how they are used in application development with `.env` files.

#### Creating Tasks with Environment Variables

* Create a `.env` file in the `~/test_taskfile` directory:
```bash
echo "ENDPOINT=foo.bar" > ~/test_taskfile/.env
```

* Add a task hello to `Taskfile.yml`:

```bash
version: '3'

tasks:
  hello:
    dotenv:
      - '.env'
    cmds:
      - 'echo "Endpoint is: $ENDPOINT"'
```

* Execute the task:
```bash
cd ~/test_taskfile
task hello
```

* Expected Output:
```bash
Endpoint is: foo.bar
```

#### Using System Variables

* Modify the msg task to print the HOME variable:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  msg:
    cmds:
      - 'echo "Home directory is: $HOME"'
      - 'echo "Message is: {{.MESSAGE}}"'
    vars:
      MESSAGE: FooBar
```

* Execute the task:
```bash
cd ~/test_taskfile
task msg
```

* Expected Output:
```bash
Home directory is: /home/your_username
Message is: FooBar
```

#### Overriding Environment Variables

Can override environment variables defined in `Taskfile.yml` by setting them in the system or passing them via CLI arguments.

* Override environment variables via system:

```bash
export MESSAGE=HelloWorld
task msg
```

* Expected Output:
```bash
Message is: HelloWorld
```

* Override via CLI arguments:
```bash
task msg MESSAGE=HelloWorld
```

#### Setting Default Values for Task Variables

Set default values for task variables in `Taskfile.yml` and see how they can be overridden via CLI.

* Set default value for `MESSAGE` in the msg task:

```yaml
tasks:
  msg:
    cmds:
      - 'echo "Message is: {{.MESSAGE}}"'
    vars:
      MESSAGE: '{{.MESSAGE | default "Testing123"}}'
```

* Execute the task and observe the default value:
```bash
task msg

Message is: Testing123
```

* Override the default value via CLI:
```bash
task msg MESSAGE=HelloWorld

Message is: HelloWorld
```

#### Using Shell Command Output as Variable Value

Use the output of a shell command as the value for a variable in `Taskfile`.

* Create a task os-version that prints the OS version:

```yaml
tasks:
  os-version:
    vars:
      VERSION:
        sh: cat /etc/os-release | grep "VERSION_ID" | cut -d "=" -f2
    cmds:
      - echo "OS version is {{.VERSION}}"
```

* Execute the task:
```bash
task os-version
```

* Expected Output:
```bash
OS version is 22.04
```

## Including Other Taskfiles, Task Dependencies, and Concurrent Tasks

Explore several advanced features of `Taskfile`, including the use of variables, task dependencies, and concurrent task execution. Also integrate Docker commands within `Taskfile` to automate building Docker images for different applications.

### 1. Understanding Taskfile Variables

`Taskfile` allows you to define and use variables within tasks. These variables can be passed as arguments when running a task or defined directly within the `Taskfile`.

* Taskfile configuration valid even though variables are not pre-defined

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  print:
    desc: "Prints the name and last name"
    cmds:
      - echo {{.NAME}} {{.LAST_NAME}}
```

* Command will print "Foo Bar"
``` bash
task print NAME=Foo LAST_NAME=Bar
```

### 2. Creating a Docker Build Task

Create a task template for building Docker images. The template will be reused across different tasks to build images for multiple applications.

* Create Directory and Task Template:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/test_taskfile/task-templates
```

* Create `docker-task.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  docker:build:
    desc: "Builds a Docker image"
    cmds:
      - docker build -t {{.NAME}} {{.SRC_DIR}}
```

* Save this template in `~/test_taskfile/task-templates/docker-task.yml`.

### 3. Including Task Dependencies with includes

`Taskfile` supports including other `Taskfiles`, allow to reuse tasks defined in separate files.

* Create a main `Taskfile.yml` in `~/test_taskfile` that includes the `docker-task.yml` template:

```yaml
version: '3'
includes:
  common: task-templates/docker-task.yml
tasks:
  app:build:
    cmds:
      - task: common:docker:build
        vars:
          SRC_DIR: "app1"
          NAME: "app1"
```

* Verify the setup by checking that the task correctly references the included Docker build task.

```bash
task app:build
```

### 4. Running Tasks Concurrently

`Taskfile` allows to run tasks concurrently, which can be particularly useful when we need to perform similar tasks simultaneously, such as building Docker images for multiple applications.

* Extend `Taskfile.yml` to include tasks for `app`, `app1`, and `app2`:

```yaml
version: '3'
includes:
  common: task-templates/docker-task.yml
tasks:
  app:build:
    cmds:
      - task: common:docker:build
        vars:
          SRC_DIR: "app"
          NAME: "app"

  app1:build:
    cmds:
      - task: common:docker:build
        vars:
          SRC_DIR: "app1"
          NAME: "app1"

  app2:build:
    cmds:
      - task: common:docker:build
        vars:
          SRC_DIR: "app2"
          NAME: "app2"
```

* Run the tasks concurrently:

```bash
task --parallel app:build app1:build app2:build
```

## Optimizing and Configuring Taskfile For Multiple OS

This guide focuses on running OS-specific tasks, using working directories, and optimizing task execution in `Taskfile`. Create tasks that run based on the operating system, utilize working directories, and prevent unnecessary work by fingerprinting files.

Creating and managing tasks in `Taskfile` that are specific to different operating systems, utilizing working directories for task execution, and preventing unnecessary work using fingerprinting.

### 1. Running OS-Specific Tasks

`Taskfile` allows to create tasks that are executed only on specific operating systems. This is useful when the command differ between platforms.

* Create `Taskfile` and Define `node:install` Task:

  * Create a task named node:install in the `Taskfile.yml` that installs Node.js and npm based on the OS:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  node:install:
    cmds:
      - cmd: |-
          echo "Installing nodejs and npm on Linux"
          sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
        platforms:
        - linux
      - cmd: |-
          echo "Installing nodejs and npm on macOS"
          brew install nodejs
          brew install npm
        platforms:
        - darwin
    desc: "Install Node.js and npm based on the OS"
```

* Run the Task:

  * Execute the task using the following command:

```bash
task node:install
```

  * The task will execute the appropriate commands based on your OS.

### 2. Using Working Directory for Tasks

Specify a working directory for a task using the dir attribute, which allows the task to execute commands in a specific directory.

* Define the `npm:build` Task with `SRC_DIR` Variable:

  * Create a task named `npm:build` that uses the `SRC_DIR` variable to specify the source directory:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  npm:build:
    requires:
      vars:
      - SRC_DIR
    dir: "{{.SRC_DIR}}"
    cmds:
      - npm install && npm run build
    desc: "Build the npm project in the specified source directory"
```

* Run the Task:

  * Execute the task with the specified source directory:

```bash
task npm:build SRC_DIR=~/todo/app
```

  * The task will install dependencies and build the project in the `~/todo/app` directory.

### 3. Preventing Unnecessary Work

Taskfile supports fingerprinting to prevent tasks from running unnecessarily. You can configure tasks to only run when certain files have changed.

* Create `npm:install` and `npm:build` Tasks with Fingerprinting:

  * Define the `npm:install` task to install dependencies only if package.json changes:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  npm:install:
    requires:
      vars:
        - SRC_DIR
    dir: "{{.SRC_DIR}}"
    cmds:
      - npm install
    sources:
      - package.json
    desc: "Install npm dependencies for the project in the specified source directory"
```

  * Define the `npm:build` task to build the project only if `**/*.js` files change:

```yaml
tasks:
  npm:build:
    deps:
      - npm:install
    requires:
      vars:
        - SRC_DIR
    dir: "{{.SRC_DIR}}"
    sources:
      - '**/*.js'
    cmds:
      - npm run build
    desc: "Build the npm project in the specified source directory"
```

* Run the Task:

  * Execute the task with the specified source directory:

```bash
task npm:build SRC_DIR=~/todo/app
```

  * On subsequent runs, the task will skip execution if no relevant files have changed.

## Conditional Logic, Loops

Explore advanced `Taskfile` features, including ignoring errors, using the defer feature for cleanup, implementing conditional logic, and using loops in `Taskfile`. The lab involves working with applications written in Node.js, Python, and Go, all of which are containerized using Docker.

Automating tasks for applications written in Node.js, Python, and Go. These applications are containerized using Docker. The `Taskfile.yml` provided in the `~/todo` directory includes tasks for building and pushing Docker images. Handle errors, clean up after tasks, use conditional logic, and loop over multiple tasks in Taskfile.

### 1. Ignoring Linting Errors in Node.js Application Build

When building a Node.js application, you may encounter linting errors. `Taskfile` allows you to ignore these errors using the `ignore_error: true` attribute.

* Update the npm.yml Template:

  * Modify the `~/todo/tasktemplate/npm.yml` to ignore linting errors by adding `ignore_error: true` to the lint task:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  install:
    cmds:
      - npm install

  lint:
    cmds:
      - eslint .
    ignore_error: true # Add this line to ignore linting errors
    deps: [install]

  build:
    cmds:
      - npm run build
    deps: [lint]
```

* Run the Task:
  * Test the updated task using the following command:

```bash
cd ~/todo
task ui:build
```

### 2. Cleaning Up Cache Files After Build Using defer

After building an application, it is important to clean up cache files. Taskfile's defer feature allows you to run cleanup commands after a task completes, even if it fails.

* Update the `npm.yml` Template:

  * Modify the build task in the `~/todo/tasktemplate/npm.yml` to include a cleanup task that deletes the `.cache` directory using defer:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  build:
    internal: true
    dir: '{{.SRC}}'
    cmds:
      - npm run build
      - defer: rm -rf .cache # Add this line for cleanup
    deps:
      - lint
```

* Run the Task:

  * Test the task and ensure the `.cache` directory is removed after the build completes:

```bash
cd ~/todo
task ui:build
```

### 3. Using If-Else Conditions in Taskfile

Conditional logic in `Taskfile` allows you to make tasks more dynamic. Tag Docker images with the git commit hash if available.

* Update the `docker.yml` Template:

  * Modify the `~/todo/tasktemplate/docker.yml` to include conditional logic for tagging the Docker image with the git commit hash if it exists:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  build-push:
    vars:
      GIT_TAG:
        sh: "(command -v git > /dev/null && cd {{.SRC}} && git rev-parse --short HEAD) || echo ''"
    cmds:
    - docker build --pull -t "{{.REGISTRY}}/{{.REPOSITORY}}:{{.IMAGE_TAG}}" .
    - docker push "{{.REGISTRY}}/{{.REPOSITORY}}:{{.IMAGE_TAG}}"
    - |
      {{ if .GIT_TAG }}
        echo "Tagging with git commit hash"
        docker tag "{{.REGISTRY}}/{{.REPOSITORY}}:{{.IMAGE_TAG}}" "{{.REGISTRY}}/{{.REPOSITORY}}:{{.GIT_TAG}}"
        docker push "{{.REGISTRY}}/{{.REPOSITORY}}:{{.GIT_TAG}}"
      {{ end }}
```

* Run the Task:

  * Execute the task with the following command:

```bash
cd ~/todo
task docker:build-push IMAGE_TAG=latest REGISTRY=localhost:5000 REPOSITORY=app1 SRC=./app1
```

### 4. Re-running Tasks After Adding Git to App

Now that git has been added to the app1 directory, re-run the task to build and push the Docker image with both the latest tag and the git commit hash tag.

* Run the Task:

  * Use the following command to build and push the Docker image:

```bash
cd ~/todo
task docker:build-push IMAGE_TAG=latest REGISTRY=localhost:5000 REPOSITORY=app1 SRC=./app1
```

### 5. Using Looping in Taskfile

`Taskfile` allows to loop over a list of items, which is useful for running the same task on multiple applications.

* Create a Loop to Build and Push All Docker Images:

  * Add a task in `Taskfile.yml` to build and push Docker images for all three applications (app1, app2, and app3) using a loop:

```yaml
tasks:
  build-push-all:
    cmds:
    - for:
      - app1
      - app2
      - app3
      task: docker:build-push
      vars:
        IMAGE_TAG: "latest"
        REGISTRY: "localhost:5000"
        REPOSITORY: "{{ .ITEM }}"
        SRC: "{{ .ITEM }}"
```

* Run the Task:

  * Test the task by running:

```bash
task build-push-all
```

## Integrating Taskfile with CICD Pipelines

Using Taskfile in GitLab CI/CD pipelines to build and deploy applications in a reusable and templated manner. By following these steps, you will learn how to integrate Taskfile with GitLab to avoid code duplication and streamline CI/CD workflows.

Integrate Taskfile with GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment processes. You'll work with a Taskfile that is stored in a remote repository and include it in your application repository to leverage predefined tasks.

### 1. Introduction to Taskfile in GitLab CI/CD

Taskfile is a versatile tool that can be used across different CI/CD pipelines, including GitLab CI/CD. This approach helps avoid code duplication and makes the tasks reusable, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### 2. Including a Remote Taskfile

You will include a remote Taskfile from another GitLab repository into the Taskfile.yml of your application repository.

* Include the Remote Taskfile:

  * Navigate to the tasktemplates repository in GitLab and open the raw URL of the Taskfile.yml file.

  * Modify the Taskfile.yml of your application repository to include the remote Taskfile:

```yaml
version: '3'
includes:
  app: https://github.com/root/tasktemplates/Taskfile.yml
```

* Verify the Inclusion:

  * Ensure that the remote Taskfile has been successfully included by running the following command:

```bash
cd ~/todo/app
git pull
```
